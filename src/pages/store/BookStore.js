This story, which takes place on another planet, explores
how it would be to find yourself in a place where there is
no separation from God, a place where everything is
different because of that. How will it look? How will you
then live? What will you be able to report back to the
strictly scientific people who sent you here from Earth?

A second contingent of astronauts arriving on Planet Deep
Delta T threatens to drastically interfere with the idyllic,
peaceful life of the established community. What impact

Two astronauts and two Natives from Deep Delta T make
the passage through four-and-a-half light years of cold and

such a collision.</p>

           <h4> Christianese, the Language of Those Who Believe in
Jesus:</h4>
Church people joke sometimes about having their own
language – ‘Christianese.’ People who have no familiarity
with Christianity have no understanding of words like
‘atonement,’ ‘salvation,’ and ‘grace.’ Here are 285
Christian words explained in a reader-friendly style,
without any particular denominational slant. These pages
are particularly helpful to those new to Christianity to help
them gain understanding of the puzzling world of faith in
Jesus..</p>

            <h4>Around the World in 480 Days:</h4>
World travel was safer in 1971. Thousands of hippies were
crowding aboard busses and trains in Europe and Asia,
hungry to experience something new. One 22-year-old,
the author, remembers his year traveling overland around
the world, spending extended times in both Japan and
Pakistan. His very personal accounts of immersion in
unfamiliar cultures is not a travelogue, but reveals a story

of discovery that emerges partly as a product of the 70’s,
and partly as the view of youth.</p>

          <h4> Doodler’s Mandala: </h4> 
          

Even for people who protest that they cannot draw, this brief 
little book shows that fascination, self discovery, and relaxation await 
those who will take some time to draw mandalas – an ancient art form used
 in many ways by many cultures. It is an instructional book, inspiring your 
 creative discovery, not a coloring book, 
and by no means an exhaustive examination of the subject. Just for fun.
